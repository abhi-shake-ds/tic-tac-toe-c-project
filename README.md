# tic-tac-toe-c-project
A console-based, modular Tic-Tac-Toe game in C that pits a human player against a computer. The project illustrates input validation, game logic, structured programming with multiple source files, and appropriate header file usage.
The primary goal is to illustrate fundamental C ideas like:

Modular design and functions

Loops and arrays

Conditional reasoning

Validation of input

usage of header files (.h)

Multi-file compilation

The game permits:
a player to engage in human competition, or
A participant to compete with the computer

The project is neat, structured, and simple to comprehend or expand because the game logic is implemented across several source files.

Currently, the computer opponent chooses any available cell at each turn using a random-move strategy.

This project adheres closely to the guidelines' specified coding standards and academic folder structure.
